DEMOTOOL + GO SPACE
===================

Demotool: helps in creating non-interactive demos. The code behind the
	  demo can be modified, recompiled and reloaded without
	  closing the window that shows the resulting image.

Go Space: a demo published at Alternative Party 2010

Requirements
============

Packages required by the demotool:
  gtkmm    (C++ interface for GTK+)
  gtkglext (OpenGL support for GTK+)

Packages required by stand-alone demo player:
  SDL      (Simple DirectMedia Layer)

Packages required by all demos:
  GLU      (OpenGL Utility Library)
  GLEW     (OpenGL Extension Wrangler)

Packages specifically required by Go Space:
  SDL_sound with XM support (sound/music extension for SDL)

Compiling and usage
===================

To compile, type "make". This will compile the common parts and any
projects defined in top-level Makefile.

To run a project in demotool, run "./demotool projectname". The demotool 
will find file renderer.so in the specified directory and use it to 
render frames of the demo.

The stand-alone version of a project is created in the project
directory. Run this as you usually would.
